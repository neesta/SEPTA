#SEPTA's Regional Rail Arrival Info

Detail view of all regional rail trains heading outbound to their destination station. Now includes a drop-down menu to select other lines. This was something I built quickly for my wife one day, because her SEPTA iOS app kept crashing.

• Uses the [SEPTA Regional Rail TrainView API](http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/) to pull in a JSON file and display details about the train(s).

• Uses [Google's Javascript Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to display a map with the train's current location.
